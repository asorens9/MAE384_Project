The project will focus on modeling the spread of an infectious disease using the SIR model (Susceptible-
Infected-Recovered). The SIR model contains a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe
how individuals in a population transition between three states: susceptible, infected, and recovered.
The goal of this project is to provide students with a deeper understanding of how numerical methods are
applied to solve real-world problems in epidemiology. By simulating the spread of infectious diseases using
the SIR model, students will explore how mathematical equations can predict epidemic dynamics and inform
public health decisions. Through the integration of solving ODEs, interpolation, data fitting, and spectral
analysis, students will gain practical experience with tools that bridge theory and application, empowering
them to tackle interdisciplinary challenges in science and engineering.
The project will integrate the following topics:
1. Numerical solution of the ODE systems.
2. Interpolation.
3. Least Squares.
4. Fourier Analysis.
Project Preparation and Submission
The students will work in the groups of four. The students are to divide the work equally between the team
members. All programming need to be done in MATLAB. Built-in MATLAB functions for ODE solution,
least square sand interpolation can not be used in this project. All programs need to be self-written. The
students can use built-in MATLAB fft function for Fourier analysis. The project needs to be created and
managed in GitHub. Please, see the instructions on how to use GitHub posted on Canvas.

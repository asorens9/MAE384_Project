In this project, we focused on modeling the spread of infectious diseases using the SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered). The SIR model is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describes how individuals move between three states: susceptible (those who can become infected), infected (currently carrying the disease), and recovered (no longer infectious). Our goal was to understand how numerical methods can be applied to solve real-world problems in epidemiology, specifically using the SIR model to simulate and analyze the spread of diseases.

Through this project, we explored how mathematical equations help predict the dynamics of an epidemic and inform public health strategies. Along the way, we applied techniques such as solving ODEs numerically, performing interpolation, fitting data using least squares, and conducting Fourier analysis. This combination of methods gave us hands-on experience bridging mathematical theory with real-world applications, preparing us to address interdisciplinary challenges in science and engineering.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the tasks and how we approached them:

Numerical Solution of ODE Systems

We implemented numerical methods (like the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method) to solve the SIR model equations.
These equations described how the populations in the susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments changed over time.
Interpolation

Using interpolation, we estimated values between known data points to better understand the trends in the disease dynamics.
Least Squares

This technique allowed us to fit models to data, minimizing the differences between the predicted and actual values, which helped refine our simulation.
Fourier Analysis

Using Fourier transforms, we analyzed frequency components in the data, which could provide insights into periodic patterns in epidemic waves.
